Notable sections to look at are: [Model Layer](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/#the-model-layer), [View Layer](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/#the-view-layer) and [Development Process](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/#the-development-process)  |
| [Two Scoops of Django](https://www.pdf-archive.com/2016/08/07/two-scoops-of-django-1-8/two-scoops-of-django-1-8.pdf) | This is more optional but a great book for learning Django and very useful. While you don't need to read it all, especially in the first 2 weeks, keep it in mind as you become more and more familiar with the framework and codebase. |
