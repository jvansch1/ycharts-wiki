This is an outline of some of the key points in our development process.

### Requirements
Gathering requirements for a project or piece of work comes from usually 2 places. It either is business requirement (ie. Add a feature to this  that will come from the Product Manager, or a technical requirement that would come from the engineering team (ie. Upgrade library x to version 10)

### Ticketing
Once we understand the requirements the next part of our development process is what we call "ticketing" out the project. The goal here is break the deliverable up in to single tickets that represent logical pieces of a deliverable. 

A good ticket should:
* be no longer than a days worth of work (3 Points in Pivotal Tracker)
* be understandable by anyone with limited context.
* be well defined in terms of the deliverable of the ticket.
