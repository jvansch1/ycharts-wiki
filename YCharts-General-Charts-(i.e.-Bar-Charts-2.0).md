# Intro
The purpose of this document is provide details about the project to replace the current flot based based on ycharts.com 

# Goal
Our goal is to replace the current bar charts, with a new, more flexible and functional charting stack that can
1) Effectively replace all the current bar charts used on the site.
2) Can do more than bar charts! Line charts, stacked bars, and may be others!
3) Is fully dynamic such that, some day, we could build a single page app where-in users can create your own custom charts.
4) Has full node/"chart generator" support, such that users can save/share charts like they can with fundamental charts.
