###Basic Considerations

What currency do the financial statements come in?  If USD, how is foreign currency converted?  If not, can we convert to USD?

How do you handle restatements?  Example: AAPL restated 3 years worth of data when they changed their accounting for Revenue Recognition
See: http://www.investopedia.com/stock-analysis/2009/New-Accounting-Rules-To-Accelerate-Revenue-Recognition-AAPL-CSCO-WSTL1109.aspx#axzz1xbD0Sj9f

How do you handle changes in fiscal years?  Example: Jefferies Group (JEF) changed their fiscal year in 2009, as did Goldman Sachs (GS)
This led to 2 month quarters

How do you handle 4th quarter information?  Do the 4 quarters sum to the fiscal year number?

Can you give us a list of the quality checks you run on the data?

Do you adjust for splits?  If so, how?

How do you deal with spin-offs?  What happens with quarterly numbers in this case?  Example: MO in Fiscal Year 2006

What nuance do you give around net income (onetime items, discontinued operations, etc.)?  Earnings per share?

Do you offer data on notes to the financial statements?  How standardized are they? 

Do you offer data on the company's operating segments?

How are the companies uniquely idenified?

If the company changes its symbol AND changes it's CUSIP at the same time, do you lose history for the company under the new symbol (GTAT, MNST)?

Can all or portions of the data be made available for download, for free and/or for premium users of your site?
