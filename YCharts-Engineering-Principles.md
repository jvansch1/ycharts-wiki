# YCharts Engineering Principles

## Ownership is distributed
There are no dark corners in our code and it’s always appropriate for an engineer to work on every part of our system. We always make a point to leave something better than when we found it.

## All development is done incrementally
Our deliverables are well-defined, concise and achievable. Real product progress comes from crossing multiple finish lines, not from completing one long race.

## Anticipate change
We write code that keeps up with changing technology and evolving business requirements. True software durability is expressed in its ability to change, not in how long it can remain the same.

## Modularity enables growth
Our software is componentized and single purposed. We continually review our architectural boundaries and refactor when component reuse is at risk. We can only continue to add value to the product for as long as we can maximize use of the things we build.

## Success is in the details
Our domain requires precision. Every line of code matters and we stay focused on doing things right the first time… after we review it twice.

## Build to a higher standard
We have an advantage many organizations in our industry do not; we started in the 21st century. We take advantage of many decades of proven good software practices championed by others and always look to incorporate proven software design elements, tools and processes.

## Code for the next engineer
Complex software isn’t written in a vacuum, and we always write code with the goal of leaving it in good shape for the next engineer. We understand that sometimes something that is fun to write, isn’t very fun to read and make an effort to not code-in roadblocks. 

## Rely on the richness of the domain
Finance is a mature industry with its own language. We orient our domain model to mirror that maturity and use it to remain empathetic with our customers and enforce commonality with other parts of our business.

## Abstraction is the key to innovation
If we had to invent cement everytime we built a bridge, we’d all be great swimmers. We work to strengthen the core parts of our system, formalize them as core services and combine/ build atop them to achieve the complexity and utility our customers expect.
