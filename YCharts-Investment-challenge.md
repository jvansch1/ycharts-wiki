# YCharts Investment Challenge 2018

Welcome to YCharts NYC's first investment challenge. The goal is simple: build a portfolio with the highest NAV.

## Rules
### 1. All research & financial information must come from YCharts.

This is the cardinal rule. Within reason, this applies to news, events, financial data, etc. What can't be found on `ycharts.com` may not factor into the decision process.

### 2. YCharts is the official source of truth.

Any discrepancies in data, reports, news, etc. will defer to the information on `ycharts.com`. If incorrect data is present on our site, it will nonetheless be the accepted truth until it is resolved.

### 3. You may share tips and methods freely with others.

The primary goal is for us to become more familiar with investing in general, and understand YCharts from the perspectives of our clients. Therefore, sharing comp tables, charts, watchlists, and other tools with each other is encouraged for the sake of knowledge sharing. 

That being said, feel free to closely guard your secret sauce, if that's how you wish to live your life...

### 4. Respect the honor system.

Please respect the rules of the game. Unlawful or nefarious trading practices are not permitted. Let's be sportsmen of the highest rank. A victory won without honor is no victory at all. 


## Game

1. If you have not done so already, create an account with [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/simulator/home.aspx). Once you have done so, slack me (`@lucas`) your account email and I will invite you to YCharts' private game.
