YCharts uses [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/) to manage engineering projects at their most granular level. It is the tool we lean on to define distinct bodies of work that will be written, reviewed and merged into the codebase. It is important that we as a team use the tool effectively and consistently as we use it as a source of asynchronous communication between developers and engineering leaders. We should, for example, be able get a rough idea of how far a long a project is looking at how how many points of a large "epic" are completed. We should be able to tell what engineer is working on what exact task at any given time by looking at the "Current" column of a project board. And so on.
