# Overview
YCharts uses [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/) to manage engineering projects at their most granular level. It is the tool we lean on to define distinct bodies of work that will be written, reviewed and merged into the codebase. It is important that we as a team use the tool effectively and consistently as we use it as a source of asynchronous communication between developers and engineering leaders. We should, for example, be able get a rough idea of how far along a project is by looking at how how many points of a large "epic" are completed. We should be able to tell what engineer is working on what exact task at any given time by looking at the "Current" column of a project board. And so on. 

# Project Boards

## Boards Basics
For YCharts, Project Boards represent the the collective work and output of a team. 

Currently, YCharts has 5 Project boards
*Data* - All data importing, calculating related projects
*Applications* - All front-end application projects
*Core* - PDF reports, quote pages and other projects that have a mix of front-end and back end components. Note, YCharts may have multiple Core teams but will share one Core project board
*Systems* - AWS and developer infrastructure related projects
*Excel* - Excel Add-in related projects

## Current/Backlog/Icebox
The Current, Backlog and Icebox columns of a project board should contain tickets that are in specific states. Care should be taken by each engineer to ensure their tickets are in the right column.

*Current* - Represents works that the engineer is currently working on, or has finished working on and is awaiting review. **Nothing** else should be in current. 

*Backlog* - Represents the next
