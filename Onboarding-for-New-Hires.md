# Reading List
During the first two weeks as a new hire, reading will be a large part of the job. Below is a list of resources that a new hire should read in order to get up to speed. 

> Note: Feel free to to add anything you find useful in getting up to speed

| Resource  | Notes | 
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [YCharts Engineering Principles](https://github.com/ycharts/ycharts/wiki/YCharts-Engineering-Principles)  | These are the principles we as engineers try (no one is perfect) to live by as engineers here at YCharts.  |
| [YCharts Principles]()  | These are the principles all employees live by here at YCharts. |
| [YCharts Code Guidelines](https://github.com/ycharts/ycharts/wiki/Code-Guidelines)  | Helpful engineering guidelines |
| [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)  | This is the Style Guide we follow for Python |
| [Django Documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/)  | Having a bookmark or link to the Django documentation is crucial for any Django developer. Notable sections to look at are: [Model Layer](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/#the-model-layer), [View Layer](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/#the-view-layer) and [Development Process](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/#the-development-process)  |
| [Two Scoops of Django](https://www.pdf-archive.com/2016/08/07/two-scoops-of-django-1-8/two-scoops-of-django-1-8.pdf) | This is a great book for learning Django and very useful. While you don't need to read it all, especially in the first 2 weeks, keep it in mind as you become more and more familiar with the framework and codebase. |

# Git Tutorial
Whether you know git or not this is a great [Git tutorial](http://learngitbranching.js.org/) to go through.


# Django Tutorial
Create a Django Polls app by following the [Django Tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/intro/tutorial01/).
Deliverable should be a working Django Polls app on your github repo called `django-polls`. 

> As you go through creating it, ask Engineers any questions you have or if you need any help!



# Walkthroughs
After reading the above resources and having a look at the codebase any new hire should have multiple walkthroughs with a Product Manager as well as Engineers. These should be scheduled during the first week. If not speak up please!

| Type  | Description | 
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Product | Product Manager should walk through all the different parts of the site, what they do and why they are valuable for our customers. |
| Frontend | Engineer should go over how Django and Angular play nice. How CSS and JS work and what Django Templates are. | 
| Backend | Engineer should go over our Django codebase. | 
| Systems Architecture | Engineer should explain what YCharts looks like from a systems perspective. What are Admin vs. Web servers, how does the queue work? | 
| Development Process | Engineer should go over how we release code from getting a requirement in Pivotal Tracker to releasing it to the development branch. Also should cover our use of git. |
