# Git Tutorial
Whether you know git or not this is a great [Git tutorial](http://learngitbranching.js.org/) to go through.


# Django Tutorial
Create a Django Polls app by following the [Django Tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/intro/tutorial01/).
Deliverable should be a working Django Polls app on your github repo called `django-polls`. 

> As you go through creating it, ask Engineers any questions you have or if you need any help!



# Walkthroughs
After reading the above resources and having a look at the codebase any new hire should have multiple walkthroughs with a Product Manager as well as Engineers. These should be scheduled during the first week. If not speak up please!

| Type  | Description | 
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Product | Product Manager should walk through all the different parts of the site, what they do and why they are valuable for our customers. |
