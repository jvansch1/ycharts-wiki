# 1st Month
### Week 1
Your first week will be a little bit slower than most at YCharts as you get setup and meet our team. We encourage your to **write down as much as you can** and there are never too many questions.

- [ ] On your couple of days you will need to setup a few things. The following setup items are **required** not optional so do each of them:
    * Environment, IDE (We as a team use PyCharm and will make your life better if you use it)
      * [Download the latest Professional version](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=mac). Sign up for the trial and once it expires let your manager know so they can add you to the account.
    * Setup Wifi (`ycharts-secure`). You should have been given credentials to connect from your manager.
    * Setup VPN. You should have been given your VPN credentials to connect from your manager. [Instructions](https://github.com/ycharts/ycharts/wiki/YCharts-VPN-Setup-Instructions)
    * Setup YCharts Staging & Production account. 
        * Your account will not have a password so you will need to reset it in both environments. Your email is your ycharts email (i.e. xyz@ycharts.com)
            * Staging Password Reset Link: https://staging.ycharts.com/accounts/password_reset
            * Production Password Reset Link: https://ycharts.com/accounts/password_reset
        * Login to [YCharts Admin Site](https://ycharts.com/admin/) and setup your 2FA with your google authenticator.
    * Setup your Google calendar
    * make sure you accept the events you are invited to. We rely heavily on our google calendars for scheduling everything from daily meetings to 1 on 1s with your manager to reviews. Highly recommended to use the [slack plugin for google calendar](https://slack.com/app-pages/google-calendar). 
    * External Accounts Setup
      * Go through the [full list](https://github.com/ycharts/ycharts/wiki/Setting-Up-Accounts-for-New-Hires) accounts one by one and make sure you have access to all of them. You should have received emails from each of them asking you to confirm joining. If you don't have access and can not find the email for any of those accounts, please reach out to your manager. It is very important that you are able to login to each of them.
      * Download the slack desktop application [link](https://slack.com/downloads/mac)
        * Be sure to install 2 necessary plugins: [Google Calendar](https://ycharts.slack.com/apps/ADZ494LHY-google-calendar) and [Github](https://ycharts.slack.com/apps/A8GBNUWU8-github)
        * Once you have the Github Slack app installed follow these [instructions](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-your-scheduled-reminders) to setup reminders so you know when PRs are approved, require changes, re-assigned, etc.
      * You need to add a gmail filter that archives away developer emails that are sent when you or another developer does something locally that causes an email to get sent. 
        * The screenshot of the filter you need to add is below, if you have problems adding it ask a colleague![filter](https://i.imgur.com/mAhxXge.png)
        * The XML Gmail filter is [here](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/KFoxder/8552361f1a59ba069db05fac2f801669/raw/d5996b599e5130f7dcae2bbd15c8b6e595e2e2b2/ycharts_engineering_gmail_filter.xml). Instructions on how to import a Gmail filter are [here](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6579?hl=en)
    * Add Zenefits vacation calendar in Google Calendar so you know when other people are away.
      * [Instructions on how to add the calendar](https://help.zenefits.com/Time_Off/FAQs_About_Calendars_in_Zenefits/How_do_I_add_a_Zenefits_calendar_to_Google_Calendar%3F/)
