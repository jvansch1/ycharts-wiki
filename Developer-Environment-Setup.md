```

## Setup Github and Git
1. Generate an SSH key: [Instructions](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
1. Add this new SSH key to your Github Account: [Instructions](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)
1. Add your ssh key to ssh-agent explicitly:
    ```bash
    ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    ```

## Setup local development directory

> NOTE: Depending on your operating system there are two different steps. Please check your operating system version first before proceeding. To do so click ï£¿ > About This Mac.

**Mac OS => 10.15 (Catalina):**
1. Copy and paste the following into your terminal:
    ```bash
    mkdir ~/sites
    touch /etc/synthetic.conf
    echo "sites\t/Users/`whoami`/sites" | sudo tee /etc/synthetic.conf
    ```
2. After copying and pasting, you must restart your computer.

**Mac OS <= 10.14 (Mojave):**
1. Copy and paste the following into your terminal:
    ```bash
    sudo mkdir -p /sites
    cd /sites
    sudo chown -R `whoami` /sites/
    ln -s /sites ~/sites
    ```

## Setup Git-Secret
> Read more about git secret here: https://github.com/ycharts/ycharts/wiki/Git-Secret

1. Install `git-secret` via Homebrew
    ```bash
    brew install git-secret
    ```
1. Install `gpg`. 
    ```bash
    brew install gnupg
    ```
1. Create a `gpg` key. Follow the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/generating-a-new-gpg-key#generating-a-gpg-key). You should add this `GPG` key to your github account as well.
1. Export the `GPG` by following the instructions below. Send whoever is guiding your onboarding experience your public key in a `.txt` file. Do not proceed until they have pushed your keyring. Ask them to confirm before moving forward with the setup.
    ```bash
    # Export Public key via
    # Find KEY ID
    gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG
    # Save your public key to a text file located at "~/Documents/new_engineer.txt"
    gpg --armor --export [KEY ID] >> ~/Documents/new_engineer.txt
    ```
1. These instructions are not for the engineering setting up their environment but for the onboarding engineer. The onboarding engineer needs to do the following before you can proceed:
    ```bash
    # Download the public key to a local directory (ie ~/Downloads/new_engineer.txt)
    gpg --import ~/Downloads/new_engineer.txt
    cd /sites/ycharts
    git checkout develop
    git pull origin develop
    git secret tell newengineer@example.com
    git secret reveal -f; git secret hide
    git commit -am "Added Engineer's Name to git secret."
    git push origin develop
    ```

## Install MySQL

```bash
# Install MySQL -- DON'T RUN ANY COMMANDS HOMEBREW TELLS YOU TO RUN AFTER INSTALLATION!
brew install mysql@5.7

echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/mysql@5.7/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zprofile
source ~/.zprofile

# Make a symlink so generic mysql commands link to 5.7 version
ln -s /usr/local/opt/mysql@5.7 /usr/local/opt/mysql

# Copy YCharts MySQL plist file to correct location so MySQL runs on startup
mkdir -p ~/Library/LaunchAgents
cp /sites/ycharts/confs/database/com.ycharts.mysql.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
# Start MySQL now
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ycharts.mysql.plist

# Create ycharts database
mysql -u root

# Run the following commands in the mysql shell
CREATE DATABASE ycharts CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
GRANT ALL ON ycharts.* to 'ycharts'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'ycharts';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

# now get out of mysql
exit
```

The commands to stop and start MySQL are:

```bash
# To stop MySQL
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ycharts.mysql.plist
# To start MySQL
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ycharts.mysql.plist
```

### Load MySQL data
Now that MySQL is installed you need data in there. Every week we dump our most recent staging data to a server that is on the premise so that if developers need a new database they can get it whenever they want. You will need to do this right now while you set your environment up but this will also be something you do once a week or once every couple of weeks so that you always have data locally that reflects what is in staging. 

1. Before you start copying 400GB of data. Make sure you are connected to the internet via an Ethernet. You should have a Ethernet to USB-C adapter with you. If you don't please ask Fox for one since someone forget to put it on your desk. If you have one of the new CableMatters adapters, go to
[their site](http://www.asix.com.tw/download.php?sub=driverdetail&PItemID=131 "Welcome to 1995")
to download the drivers.  Choose: Apple Mac OS X 10.6 to 10.9 Drivers Installer.
1. Open the finder and you should see the YCharts's Mac Mini in your "Shared" network. It will prompt you to login. Ask the nearest developer or Fox what the password and username is.
1. Copy the `ycharts_db` folder containing the database files from the database restore machine (Mac Mini)
or another developer's computer to your home folder (`~`). This will take around ~3 hours.
2. Once you have a copy of the database folder, you should be able to follow the
[directions for restoring your database](https://github.com/ycharts/ycharts/wiki/Restoring-Database).
and you will have a fresh MySQL 5.7 database! Once the below command finishes, you should have a fresh database.
```bash
/sites/ycharts/scripts/restore_database.sh -c
```

## Install Vagrant and VirtualBox
Now you will need to create your local Linux VM machine that will serve as your local development environment.
1. Install [Vagrant 2.2.9](https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant/2.2.9/vagrant_2.2.9_x86_64.dmg)
2. Install [Virtualbox 6.1.10](https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/6.1.10/VirtualBox-6.1.10-138449-OSX.dmg)

### Configure Vagrant NFS
More detailed instructions of configuring your NFS can be found in Vagrant's [documentation](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/synced-folders/nfs.html#root-privilege-requirement), however, the following steps is all you should need to do.

1. Edit the sudoers file (must be done as root using the visudo command)
    ```bash
    sudo visudo
    ```
2. Add `Cmnd_Alias` entries. Under the line `# Cmnd alias specification`
    ```
    # Cmnd alias specification
    Cmnd_Alias VAGRANT_EXPORTS_ADD = /usr/bin/tee -a /etc/exports
    Cmnd_Alias VAGRANT_NFSD = /sbin/nfsd restart
    Cmnd_Alias VAGRANT_EXPORTS_REMOVE = /usr/bin/sed -E -e /*/ d -ibak /etc/exports
    ```
3. Add User privileges. The `# User privilege specification` should look like.
    ```
    # User privilege specification
    root    ALL=(ALL) ALL
    %admin  ALL=(ALL) ALL
    %admin ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: VAGRANT_EXPORTS_ADD, VAGRANT_NFSD, VAGRANT_EXPORTS_REMOVE
    ```
4. Save and close the `/etc/sudoers` file.

## Provision your Vagrant virtual machine
1. Run the below commands. 
    > NOTE: This can take about 30-45 minutes
    ```bash
    cd /sites/ycharts
    workon ycharts_systems
    vagrant --run_initial_setup up --provision
    ```
2. Test that the setup worked correctly by 
    > NOTE: After running these commands it should respond with: "No migrations to apply."
    ```bash
    vagrant ssh
    yc_migrate
    ```

## Initialize Lists and Sets
What are list and sets? Good question! So when we talk about "lists" and "sets" we are usually referring to the list and sets we store in redis. They power parts of our application and to have a fully setup local environment you will need to populate the redis you installed in the previous steps.

1. In order to populate redis we need Celery to be running.
```bash
vagrant ssh
yc_celery
# do not close this window. Let it sit.
```
2. Open a new window on your Terminal and copy and paste the following into the terminal:
> NOTE: This will take a few hours. While this is happening in the background you can continue with all other steps.
```bash
vagrant ssh
screen -d -m python /sites/ycharts/manage.py calculations_store_sets
screen -d -m python /sites/ycharts/manage.py securities_info_store_sets
screen -d -m python /sites/ycharts/manage.py security_lists_store_lists
```

## Setup Webpack / Frontend
Our newer redesigned frontend uses webpack to compile and bundle our frontend static assets. When running the site locally webpack has the ability to watch for any file changes and re-compile any JS or CSS if the files change. This process is known as "hot reloading". This feature makes it very easy to write JS and reload your local page and see the changes you made take effect immediately.

There are 2 ways to run webpack. You can run it locally on your Mac OS or you can run it in the Vagrant virtual machine on your linux OS. If you are actively writing javascript and want to take advantage of "hot-reloading" so you can make changes and see their effects you will want to run webpack locally, however if you are making any changes to `package.json` or `package-lock.json` you **must** be running webpack via the virtual machine.

> **IMPORTANT NOTE:**
When running webpack hot reloading on your local machine (Mac), do not check in the `package-lock.json` if it is modified. You should only checkin the `package-lock.json` if you have modified anything in `package.json` and have run `npm run dev` within your vagrant machine. 

#### Running Webpack locally (Recommended for development)
To run it locally copy and paste the following into a terminal:
```sh
cd /sites/ycharts
rm -rf node_modules/ 
nvm use 10
npm i
npm run dev
```

#### Running Webpack Virtually (Required for updating npm packages)
```sh
cd /sites/ycharts
rm -rf node_modules/ 
vagrant ssh
npm i
npm run dev
```

## Configure PyCharm

Follow the steps here to configure PyCharm: https://github.com/ycharts/ycharts/wiki/PyCharm-Configuration

## Create Local User account

### Create User
You will also need to create a new `User` account in your local database, with access to all of YChart's features. To get around the catch-22 of setting up a new user via the `/admin` panel, enter the django shell:

```bash
vagrant ssh
python manage.py shell_plus
```
and create a new user:
```python
user = User(email=<your_email>, is_staff=True, is_superuser=True)
user.set_password(<your_password>)
user.save()
```

### Setup User
1. Now, start a django server by ssh into Vagrant (`cd /sites/ycharts && vagrant ssh`)
1. Now once you are inside your vagrant instance run `yc_django` and go to `http://0.0.0.0:8000/admin/` to log in. 
1. From here, head to `Users` section and create a `PartnerSubscription` for your account. ![](https://imgur.com/RuJsro3.png)  ![](https://imgur.com/UkMLmTl.png)
1. Add your user to the [YCharts Staff Client Group](http://localhost:8000/admin/accounts/clientgroup/62/) [![Screenshot from Gyazo](https://gyazo.com/faf60276b187e0622509315ec3160696/raw)](https://gyazo.com/faf60276b187e0622509315ec3160696)
1. Add your user to the `web_admins`, `systems`, and `testers` groups in the Admin interface (under the `Administrative` tab for the user). Don't worry if the box on the right doesn't expand.
![Screenshot of adding user to groups](https://i.imgur.com/WQFueNM.png)


> Note: You should now have access to all features in your local environment however you will need to do the same in staging and production. 


## Setup Chart Generator Repo
Now that you have setup the `ycharts` repo and `ycharts_systems` the next step is to set up the `ycharts_chart_generator` repository. [Follow these instructions](https://github.com/ycharts/ycharts_chart_generator/wiki/Developer-Environment-Setup)
